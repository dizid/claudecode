# Wrap Up Session

Generate a session summary and save it for continuation later.

## Instructions

1. Create the summary with the following sections:
   - **Project**: The current project name/path
   - **What we worked on**: List the main tasks/features
   - **Files changed**: Key files created or modified
   - **Current state**: What's working, what's not
   - **Next steps**: What to do when resuming
   - **Pending issues**: Any blockers or things to remember

2. Save the summary to `~/.claude/summaries/` with filename format:
   `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-project-name.md`

   Example: `2026-01-05-14-30-cv.md`

3. Create the summaries directory if it doesn't exist.

4. Display the summary to the user and confirm the file was saved.

Keep it brief and actionable.
